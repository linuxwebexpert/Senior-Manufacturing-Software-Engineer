Nevadanano Technology Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Nevadano Technology Coding Challenge where potential candidates will prove their knowledge of front-end apllications communicating with a backend server database for the purpose of demonstrating a simple chat system that uses a backend database to filter words using profanity words.

Please take time to carefully review our job description and the required skills for this job opportunity.

1. Write a NodeJS and web sockets chat room application
2. Connect the chat room to a PHP & MySQL backend profanity filter using AJAX
3. Allow the moderator to add and delete words from the banned words list

Here a few examples from the web on how-to accomplish this challenge:

- https://socket.io/get-started/chat
- https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/mysql-bad-word-filter/34316/3

The rules are fairly simple and adherence to these principles is greatly appreciated.

- No copy & pasting of code fragments, be original
- Make small incremental git commits, so work is traceable
- Include a README and INSTALL document
- Using the private repo provided to push all git changes to your branch

If you have not yet submitted your resume, please do so first, so we provide you the private repository.

The entire git repo must be complete and work on localhost or a server, so please use configuration files and environment variables.

Good luck, and we look forward to your code submission which will be reviewed and feedback provided by our senior engineers.
