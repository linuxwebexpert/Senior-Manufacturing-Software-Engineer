Nevadanano Technology Coding Challenge

Welcome to the NevadaNano Technology Coding Challenge where potential candidates will prove their knowledge of front-end applications communicating with a backend server database to demonstrate a simple chat system that uses a backend database to filter words using profanity words.

Please take time to carefully review our job description and the required skills for this job opportunity.

1. Write a NodeJS and web sockets chat room application
2. Connect the chat room to a PHP & MySQL backend profanity filter using AJAX
3. Allow the moderator to add and delete words from the banned words list

Here a few examples from the web on how to accomplish this challenge:

- https://socket.io/get-started/chat
- https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/mysql-bad-word-filter/34316/3

The rules are fairly simple and adherence to these principles is greatly appreciated.

- No copying & pasting of code fragments, be original
- Make small incremental git commits, please no large commits
- Include a README and INSTALL document
- Use the private repo provided to push all git changes to your branch

If you have not yet submitted your resume, please do so first, and we will provide you the private repository.

The entire git repo must be complete and work on localhost or a server, therefore please use configuration files and environment variables.

Good luck, and we look forward to your code submission which will be reviewed and feedback provided by our senior engineers and staff members.
